# iTop-Connected-Enclosures
This extension add connection abilities to the iTop enclosure

iTop has one CI named Encloures. This is the 'box' in witch you can add blade servers.

By default, these enclosures don't have any connection abilities, and you have to connect the power to each internal server (not really representative of the truth, for me)

This extension add the possibility to connect power (with a redundant power access, like for servers), and also to connect network (for the administative connections)
